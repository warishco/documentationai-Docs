## Overview

<Callout kind="alert">
This page is an example. Replace every concept with the real terms your product uses.
</Callout>

## The building blocks

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Pages" icon="file-text">
    Every page is an `.mdx` file. Content lives in the repo and is safe to edit.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Navigation" icon="list">
    Sidebar structure comes from `documentation.json`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Components" icon="layout-grid">
    Reusable blocks like Callouts, Steps, Tabs, and Cards keep pages consistent.
  </Card>
  <Card title="API Reference" icon="code">
    If you use it, the API tab reads from `openapi.yaml`.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Navigation shape (sample)

      "pages": [
        { "title": "Introduction", "path": "introduction" }
      ]
    }

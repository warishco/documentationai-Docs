description: What this manual is, who it’s for, and how to use it.

## Welcome to my writing manual

I wrote this manual for two reasons:

- To make my writing process visible and repeatable.
- To show how I work when I treat documentation like a product.

If you’re a content manager, content lead, or a founder, this is the fastest way
to understand how I think.

## What this is

A playbook.

Not a “perfect style guide.” Not a static manifesto.

It’s the system I use to turn fuzzy inputs into clear, shippable documentation.

## What you should read first

- [Process overview](/process/overview) for the end-to-end workflow.
- [Tools and stack](/ways-of-working/tools-and-stack) for how I run
  docs-as-code.

## How I keep this manual honest

When I change my mind, I write it down.

- I update the page.
- I add a short note in the changelog about what changed and why.

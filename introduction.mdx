## Welcome to my writing manual

<!--
  IDEA: Introduce myself (name and role);
  Hello! My name is Waricha. I'm a technical writer. This manual is where I document how I plan, write, review, publish, and maintain technical
content.

It's a living document. Expect changes as I learn and refine the system.
-->

## Why I created this manual?

I write this manual for two reasons:

- To make my writing process visible and repeatable.
- To show how I work when I treat documentation like a product.

If you’re a content manager, content lead, or a founder, this is the fastest way
to understand how I think and produce technical content.

## What you should read first

- [Process overview](/process/overview) for my end-to-end writing workflow.
- [Tools and stack](/ways-of-working/tools-and-stack) for tools and how I use
  them to create quality docs.

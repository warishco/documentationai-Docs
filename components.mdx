## Quick component tour

<Callout kind="info">
These are example components from Documentation.AI. Use them to make pages easier to scan.

<Columns cols={3}>

    Use for tips, warnings, and important notes.

### Callout: usage tips

**When to use**

- Highlight important warnings or constraints that affect success
- Call out tips that save time or prevent common mistakes
- Emphasize prerequisites, permissions, or irreversible actions

**When not to use**

- For every minor detail; overuse makes real warnings easy to ignore
- As a replacement for clear prose and headings
- To hide critical blocking information at the bottom of a long page

## Steps (sample)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a heading" icon="type">
    Start each page with a clear, short title.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explain the goal" icon="target">
    Tell readers what they will achieve.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link to next steps" icon="arrow-right">
    Point to the next page they should read.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Steps: usage tips

**When to use**

- Readers must follow actions in a specific order
- You describe tasks that can be completed in one sitting
- You want to separate conceptual explanation from hands-on actions

**When not to use**

- For unordered checklists where sequence does not matter
- To document background concepts or architecture
- For long, branching workflows that need their own dedicated guide

## Tabs (sample)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI" icon="terminal">
    ```bash
    docs init my-project
    docs dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="UI" icon="mouse-pointer">
    Open the editor, choose a page, and start writing.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Tabs: usage tips

**When to use**

- You show the same idea in multiple languages or platforms
- You provide alternate setup paths, such as CLI versus UI
- You want to keep short variants in one compact section

**When not to use**

- When one variant is strongly recommended over the others
- For long, independent flows that deserve separate pages
- When content differs so much that readers must read all variants anyway

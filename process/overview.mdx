title: Writing process overview
description: The end-to-end workflow I use to ship and maintain documentation.
---

I don’t start with words.

I start with constraints: audience, use case, product reality, and what “done”
means.

This is the end-to-end process I use to ship documentation.

## The workflow (high level)

1. Intake and scope
2. Discovery and research
3. Outline
4. Draft
5. Review and revision
6. Publish
7. Maintenance

## What I optimize for

- Time-to-first-success for the reader
- Fewer support questions caused by missing context
- Content that stays maintainable (so it doesn’t rot quietly)

## Quality gates

I treat these as “stop points” where I either fix issues or explicitly accept
tradeoffs.

- Before outlining: scope is clear enough to write
- Before drafting: outline answers the reader’s questions in the right order
- Before publishing: links work, examples are consistent, terminology is stable

## Key artifacts

- Discovery brief (inputs, assumptions, risks)
- Outline (intentional structure)
- Draft
- Review notes + resolution log
- Maintenance notes (what will change, when, and why)

## What changes as I learn

This manual is allowed to evolve.

I’ll update the process when:

- A step consistently causes rework
- Stakeholders get stuck in the same place
- Readers ask the same questions repeatedly

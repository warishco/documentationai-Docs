# Resources

This folder is a private workspace for building the Writing Manual.

Nothing in this folder is meant to be deployed.

## What goes here

- Source links, snippets, and rough notes
- Extracted ideas and frameworks I want to test
- Draft checklists before they graduate into the manual

## Rules

- Keep files in `resources/` as `.md` (not `.mdx`).
- Do not add anything in `resources/` to `documentation.json`.

## Process

1. Start with the high-level plan in [working-tree.md](working-tree.md).
2. Once having a clear picture of the structure, move to
   [information-architecture.md](information-architecture.md) to create the
   content structure.
3. Write the content for each page in the repository root or in a folder.
4. Add the pages to `documentation.json`.
5. Document the manual creation process in
   [writing-manual-devlog.md](writing-manual-devlog.md).

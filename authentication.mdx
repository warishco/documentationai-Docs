description: Sample guidance for authentication and OpenAPI usage.

## Overview

This is sample content. Replace tokens, URLs, headers, and flows with your real authentication requirements.

<Callout kind="info">

This site ships with placeholder content for authentication. Update this page and `openapi.yaml` to match your real API before sharing with users.

</Callout>

This API uses OpenAPI to describe endpoints, parameters, and responses. The reference is generated from `openapi.yaml`, so keep that file up to date as your API evolves.

## Authentication

Use a bearer token in the `Authorization` header for authenticated requests. Replace the base URL and token with values for your own API.

```bash
curl https://api.example.com/v1/example \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

<ParamField header="Authorization" param-type="string" required="true">
  `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`
</ParamField>

## Keep OpenAPI in sync

Define your authentication and base settings in `openapi.yaml` so the API Reference stays accurate and consistent.

At a minimum, you should:

- Define one or more security schemes that describe how clients authenticate (for example, bearer token, API key in a header, or other scheme).
- Reference those security schemes on operations that require authentication so they are clearly marked as secured.
- Set the correct base URL and any required global headers (for example, versioning or tenant headers) so example requests are copy-pasteable.

When your real authentication flow changes (for example, new header names, token formats, or additional requirements), update `openapi.yaml`. The generated API Reference will then reflect your current auth model without needing to edit each endpoint page by hand.

## Using the API reference

Use the API Reference to explore endpoints, required parameters, and example responses. When you change authentication headers or base URLs, update `openapi.yaml` so the generated reference matches what your clients should use.

## Common mistakes

<Expandable title="Why am I getting a 401?" default-open="false">

Verify that:

- The token is valid and not expired.
- The token is sent in the `Authorization` header.
- The header value includes the `Bearer` prefix and a space before the token.

# Writing Manual

This repository is my technical writing manual.

It’s a playbook of how I plan, write, review, publish, and maintain technical
content.

## How to use this manual

- Start with `introduction.mdx`.
- If you want the full system, read `process/overview.mdx`.

## Status

This is a living document. Expect changes as I learn and refine the system.

## Images

Use the `Image` component to add screenshots and diagrams with alt text. Always include descriptive alt text and explicit dimensions to avoid layout shift.

## When to use

Use the `Image` component when you need to:

- Add product screenshots or UI examples.
- Include diagrams or architecture overviews.
- Illustrate step-by-step procedures.
- Call out visual differences between states (for example, before vs. after).

## When not to use

Avoid using the `Image` component when:

- A short text explanation or table would communicate the idea more clearly.
- The image contains text that is not repeated elsewhere in the page.
- The image is purely decorative and does not add meaning. In this case, keep `alt` empty (`""`) so screen readers can ignore it.

## Example

<Image
  src="https://fdjsuzcsbmpqsraaooua.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/documentation-images/org-53a37986-2c9e-4094-b9e8-1e1ffae9e9ee/doc-b389b141-ae58-4fd5-91f9-6702fae9ac58/1758638266765-vc81ki2xs9-abstract-image.webp"
  alt="Abstract geometric pattern with colorful shapes"
  width="672"
  height="343"
/>

## Alt text examples

Write alt text that describes the content and purpose of the image, not just what it looks like.

**Good alt text**

- `alt="User dashboard showing project list with status badges and a New Project button"`

Why it works:

- Describes the key UI elements.
- Focuses on what matters for the task (projects, status, action button).
- Helps someone understand the interface without seeing it.

**Bad alt text**

- `alt="Screenshot"`

Why it fails:

- Gives no information about what the screenshot shows.
- Does not help screen reader users.
- Makes it harder to search or maintain images later.

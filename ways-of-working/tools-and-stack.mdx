title: Tools and stack (docs-as-code)
description:
  The workflow and tooling I use to ship documentation with a Git-based process.
---

I prefer a docs-as-code workflow because it makes writing collaborative,
reviewable, and easier to maintain over time.

## Core tools

- IDE: Windsurf
- Version control: Git + GitHub
- Writing format: Markdown / MDX
- Publishing: documentation.ai

## My default workflow

1. Create a branch for a single change.
2. Write or update the docs.
3. Self-review using a checklist.
4. Open a PR for review (even if I’m the only reviewer).
5. Merge when it’s coherent and shippable.

## What I look for in review

- Is the intent clear from the first screen?
- Are terms used consistently?
- Does each step have a reason, not just an instruction?
- Are examples accurate and minimal?

## Maintenance mindset

Docs aren’t “done.” They’re either maintained—or slowly become a liability.

When I publish, I also ask:

- What will change in 30–90 days?
- What could go stale first?
- Who should notice when it breaks?

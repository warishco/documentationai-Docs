# Now

This page is my “what I’m improving right now” log.

## Current focus

- Make the writing process section specific enough that someone else could follow it.
- Capture my real checklists and templates (not just advice).

## Next revisions

- Add 1–2 real examples (before/after) inside the process pages.
- Add a first batch of framework cards.
